# Data Structures from *Grokking Algorithms*

This repository contains implementations of various data structures Iâ€™ve learned from the book *Grokking Algorithms*.  
Each module is written with clarity and educational value in mind.

## Coming Soon

The following data structures and algorithms will be added as I continue learning:

- Tree  
- Binary Search Tree (BST)  
- Huffman Tree  
- Dijkstra's Algorithm  
- AVL Tree  
- Heap  
- Graph
